## âœ… Good Practices

- Use meaningful commit messages.

- Keep PRs focused and minimal.
- Add fixtures only if necessary, and keep them reusable.
- Favor named variables and expressive tests.

## ðŸ§ª Testing Philosophy

We aim for high-quality, readable and deterministic tests:

- Use **in-memory SQLite** (already configured).
- Favor **unit tests**, but allow behavior/integration when needed.
- Avoid side effects in test methods.
- Test **edge cases** (nulls, duplicates, invalid IDs).
