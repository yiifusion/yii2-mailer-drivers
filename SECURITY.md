## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **please do not open a public issue**. Instead, report it privately via one of the following options:

- Use GitHub's official [Security Advisories form](https://github.com/jonatas-sas/yii2-m2m-behavior/security/advisories/new)

We aim to respond to all valid reports within **48 hours**. Once the issue is confirmed, we will work on a fix and coordinate a release.
